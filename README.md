# BGP-using-Bellman-Ford-Algorithm
A brief showcase of using the Bellman-Ford algorithmic technique for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) weighting and how it might be routed in real world scenarios.

Just a small project I'm doing in order to get used to Kotlin and understand some algorthimc techniques like Bellman-Ford. 

The project includes a file called *network-final.txt* this is the file the program will be where the programs gets its network information from and each line in the file can be edited so long as the file formatting follows the example below:
| Starting Vertex(City) | Destination Vertex(City) | Weight of Connection |
|:-:|---|---|
|  Toronto | Ottawa  | 1 |
